                <p>Designated parking areas in Delhi NCR, as well as in India, are rare. It’s not uncommon to find
                    vehicles randomly parked on almost every street. Bikes are a convenient transport option and can be
                    found in almost every nook and cranny.



                    But, the streets are not the best place to leave your bikes or cycles unattended. Urban areas like
                    Delhi NCR see over 100 vehicle thefts a day, with 75 percent of them being bikes and scooters.



                    Most people won’t be able to afford anti-theft technologies. So, your bike is always in danger of
                    being stolen or even lifted by the authorities.</p>

        <p>The weather can also play spoilsport. Neglected bikes end up with damages that can be heavy on your pocket.
            If you leave bikes out for long in the rainy season, water gets accumulated and causes rusting and electric
            failures.</p>
        <p>Additionally, prolonged exposure to the sun can cause the following problems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Color degradation</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Fuel evaporation</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Fuel decomposition</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Engine oil damage</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Damage to accessories and tires</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There may be cases when you may not require your bike for a while such as when you’re on holiday, or you’re
            injured or any other reason. Rather than leave your bike unattended on the road, what can you do to ensure
            its safety?</p>
        <p>Let Us Store offers a safe, convenient, and hassle-free way for your bike storage. You won’t have to
            worry about theft or weather damage. Instead, you can be relaxed that your bike is in safe hands.</p>

            Let Us Store’s Bike Storage Facility
        </h2>
        <p>When you book a bike storage unit with Let Us Store, you can choose the storage size you want. We

        <p>Want to store more than one bike and more accessories? No problem. We have enough space for that too. A unit
            measuring 10×10 or 10×15 sq ft will work perfectly for you.</p>
        <p>We have storage spaces ranging from 48 sq ft to 290 sq ft with a minimum ceiling height of 12 feet.</p>
        <h2 class="ds-h2-sub">
            Benefits of Choosing Let Us Store’s Bike Storage
        </h2>
        <p>Apart from these two reasons, there are other benefits of choosing our service. Since 2013, Let Us Store
            has been working to create a safe storage facility for the residents around Delhi NCR.</p>
        <p>Some of the additional benefits in choosing Let Us Store are:</p>
        <h3 class="ds-h2-small">
            1. 24-Hour Video Surveillance
        </h3>
        <p>Due to a lack of CCTV cameras, the police face a major challenge in tracing stolen bikes. However, when you
            keep your bike at one of the various Let Us Store warehousing facilities, you can be assured that
            there will be 24-hour video surveillance. The footage is constantly monitored.</p>
        <p>Although no one can enter the perimeter with official IDs, and we do not allow unauthorized people to enter
            units without permission, the video surveillance is available to ensure you can cross-check.</p>
        <h3 class="ds-h2-small">
            2. Easy Booking and Storage
        </h3>
        <p>Our aim is to make the process stress-free and convenient for you. When you sign the lease agreement, you
            just need one ID proof and two colored photographs.</p>
        <p>We offer a hassle-free booking and storage process. The minimum time for storage is 30 days, while the
            maximum time can be as much as you like.</p>
        <p>If you would like to have your bike packed and moved, we can connect you to our network of vendors with an
            additional charge for it.</p>
        <p>You can make payments via checks, cash, NEFT transfers, or via PayTM.</p>
        <h3 class="ds-h2-small">
            3. Controlled Access
        </h3>
        <p>No one can access your unit without permission, not even a company employee. While signing the agreement, you
            have the option to provide a nominee. This isn’t mandatory, but is beneficial for you in case you are away
            and can’t pick it up yourself.</p>
        <p>For security reasons, we do not allow anyone else to access apart from you and your nominee. We also require
            photograph IDs every time either of you visits the unit.</p>
        <p>Rest assured, you have total privacy when you access your Storage Room and Utility Locker. Both of these are
            owned and operated only by you. There will be one key that can be used by you or your nominee.</p>
        <p>You can access the unit from 10.30 am to 6.30 pm, with extended hours for clients up to 10 pm. If you want to
            access even after that, then we can make suitable arrangements for the same with a surcharge.</p>
        <h3 class="ds-h2-small">
            4. Safety
        </h3>
        <p>Safety is our priority as much as it is your concern. Apart from constant CCTV footage surveillance, we also
            have guards monitoring the premises at all hours.</p>
        <p>Our world-class storage facilities are located in the heart of business hubs in Gurugram and Noida. They are
            convenient and safe for everyone.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the warehouse buildings are designed to keep your bikes theft, dust, water, insect, and
            rodent-proof.</p>
        <h2 class="ds-h2-sub">
            Things to Keep in Mind during Bike Storage
        </h2>
        <p>For safety measures, no inflammable items are allowed within the storage units of Let Us Store. So, we
            advise you to remove excess fuel before depositing the bike. You should empty the tank and allow everything
            to evaporate. If you intend to visit the unit frequently, you can add a fuel stabilizer and ride the bike to
            improve circulation.</p>
        <p>Here are some other precautionary measures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Pull out the battery so that it doesn’t drain and die.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Overinflate the tires to prevent soft spots or prop it on the center stand</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Spread a tarp or bedsheet to protect from dirt and dust</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Cover up the exhaust pipe to prevent insects or rodents from entering</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now that you have enough to get started, use any of the following options listed below to know more about
            Let Us Store’s services, or book a unit for your bike.</p>
